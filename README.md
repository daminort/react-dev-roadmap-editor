## Developer's Roadmap Editor

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

The work is still continued but you can check current progress 
on [Live Demo Page](https://daminort.github.io/react-dev-roadmap-editor/).

### Philosophy
<a name="philosophy"></a>

Firstly it was intended as a tool for creating, editing and
maintaining [React Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap) by
[Adam Gołąb](https://github.com/adam-golab).

But after some time of coding I realized that this tool can be used for creating any roadmaps and
moreover any diagrams that can look like roadmaps.

Of course, the work isn't finished yet, but I have strong intention to get it completed.

### Development
<a name="development"></a>

For development purposes you can simply clone this repository and start it on your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/daminort/react-dev-roadmap-editor.git
$ cd react-dev-roadmap-editor
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Possibilities
<a name="possibilities"></a>

Currently with this application you can do the follow things:
- managing page size
- adding various shapes: boxes, circles, curves
- moving and resizing shapes
- editing boxes data such as title, color, other info
- saving and downloading diagram to JSON-file (opposite operation isn't available yet, sorry) 

### TODOs: implement possibility to
<a name="todos"></a>

- attach curves to arbitrary side of shape
- restore diagram from JSON-file
- manage multilingual content of boxes
- launch simple client based on diagram for private tracking of learning progress
